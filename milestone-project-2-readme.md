##An introduction to the project

The 'MUSIC.' site offers users the chance to indulge their curiosity by searching for a musical artist or band and to preview 30 second clips of their most popular songs. The experience is clean and stripped back to allow the user to fulfill their goal easily.

The 'MUSIC.' site incorporates an API from the music streaming service 'Deezer' which hosts over 30 million tracks. Even though Deezer does offer a subscription service, the 'MUSIC.' site doesn't require the user to login to a Deezer account to perform the search or listen to the 30 second clips which opens it up to everyone. 

## UX

4. Rachael, “There’s a singer called George something who sings a really catchy song that’s stuck in my mind, but I don’t know the title of the song! I need to search for singers called George and hear their songs to try find out the title”

# WIREFRAMES

## FEATURES

The site is based around a single page layout. 
The design of the site is very stripped back, with a black and white colour scheme with neon green to highlight clicked elements. 
The site opens with the heading 'MUSIC.' and a brief introduction to the site and its features. The introduction consists of only two short sentences. The heading will appear in the top left hand side on desktop and tablet sized screens, and top center on mobile sized screens. The instruction copy will always sit below it.
The user clicks into the input box, which clears the text 'artist name here'. When the search button is clicked (NEED TO UPDATE THIS WITH OR ENTER BUTTON PRESSED) this automatically clears the value the user has input into the box. This encourages the user to repeat the process and perform another search.
Next to the input box is the search button, which will search for whatever the user has entered into the input box.
