## Testing client stories from the UX section of milestone-project-2-readme.md

1. _"I’m on my way to see Jax Jones tonight and want to see **what his most popular songs are**”_
- The user can fulfill their mission in 3 steps to show Jax Jones's most popular songs: _Type artist name into input box, click search button, click on artist name_

2. _“I’m on my way to karaoke and know I want to sing Britney Spears but can’t remember which songs I know. I want to **see a list of songs** and **hear clips of the songs** to jog my memory”_
- The user can easily fulfill the first part of their mission in 3 steps: _Type artist name into input box, click search button, click on artist name_
- To fulfill the second part of their mission, they need to add 2 more steps: _Click on song title, click play in audio source_

3. _“I want to hear Bucks Fizz songs because I’m a big fan”_
- The user can easily fulfill their mission in 5 steps: _Type artist name into input box, click search button, click on artist name, click on song title, click play in audio source_

4. _“There’s a singer called George something who sings a really catchy song that’s stuck in my mind, but I don’t know the title of the song! I might recognise the title if I saw it but would need to search for singers called George and hear the songs to try find out the title”_
- The user can easily fulfill their mission in 3 steps (which would need to be repeated for different artists): _Type artist name into input box, click search button, click on artist name_ (the user could now potentially see the song title in this list)
- The user may need to take 2 additional steps to listen to the songs to jog their memory (these steps may need to be repeated for different artists): _Click on song title, click play in audio source_
